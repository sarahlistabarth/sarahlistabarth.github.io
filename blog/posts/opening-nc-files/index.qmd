When working with raster data, one thing I've noticed is: there's a lot of obscure data formats.
And with every one of them, it takes me a while to figure out how to handle them in `R`.
So I decided to make a series of blog posts on how to handle some of the raster formats I've come across.

The first one are `.nc` files, also known as netCDF.
From what I've learned, they usually have three layers:

-   latitude
-   longitude
-   time

However, the order of these three layers varies, which means you'll have to get acquainted with your data first.
So:

1.    Get to know dataset with `ncdf4`
2.    Read in data with `terra::rast()`

## Further info

This blog post is based in parts on [R as GIS for Economists](https://tmieno2.github.io/R-as-GIS-for-Economists/work-with-netcdf.html) and an [RPubs article on ncdf4](https://rpubs.com/boyerag/297592).

# Setup

First, we load the necessary libraries.

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(terra)
library(ncdf4)
library(purrr)
```

Then, we prepare the data.
I'm taking data from the German Weather Service ([DWD](opendata.dwd.de)) for the mean temperature in 2019.

```{r}
#| label: load-data

# create temporary path and download the raster data
raster_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".nc")
download.file(
  url = "https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/grids_germany/daily/hyras_de/air_temperature_mean/tas_hyras_5_2019_v5-0_de.nc",
  destfile = raster_path,
  # it's a binary file
  mode = "wb")
```

I want to know what the weather was like on the day after the last episode of Game of Thrones aired -- May 20, 2019.
Why the day after?
Because it was usually released in American time, so one could only stream it the day after.
My assumption would be that if the weather was not great, people were more likely to watch the final episode right away.

Let's just figure out what day of the year May 20, 2019 was:

```{r}
#| label: find-out-doy

day_of_year <- strftime("20-05-2019", format = "%j") |> as.integer()
day_of_year
```

# Checking out the structure and loading the data

Let's `nc_open` this file now to check out it's structure.

## Open nc file

The first thing we do is have a look at the variable names (they're saved under `var` in the `weather` list).
Let's also check out their names, which is saved under _longname_ in this ncd4 format.
Additionally, let's find out their respective dimensions, saved under _size_.

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-structure

raster <- raster_path |> nc_open()

raster |> 
  pluck("var") |> 
  map_df(~ .x[c("longname", "size")] |> as.character()) |> 
  # you could stop here, but I wanted a nice display
  t() |> 
  data.frame() |> 
  tibble::rownames_to_column() |> 
  setNames(c("variable", "name", "dimension")) |> 
  kableExtra::kbl()
```

## Time and spatial layers {#sec-vars}

We're definitely going to need something along the lines of *latitude* and *longitude*.
From the descriptions, we can see that *lat* and *lon* describe the cell center, and their dimension is 240 $\times$ 220.
That is not what we need.
Instead, we want something with dimensions of 1--2 $\times$ 240 _or_ 220, which describes the latitude and longitude in general, not for every cell center.
In this case, that applies for *x_bnds* and *y_bnds*.

We also need something specifying the time.
In this case, that is *time_bnds*.

Let's also get the crs for good measure, *crs_HYRAS*.
This only has dimension 1, so we need to extract is as an attribute.

All of these layers can be named differently in different files, so it pays off to check out the specific name.
Let's save them into variables so we can't forget them!

```{r}
#| label: saving-spatio-temporal-variables

time <- ncvar_get(raster, "time_bnds")
lon <- ncvar_get(raster, "x_bnds")
lat <- ncvar_get(raster, "y_bnds")
crs <- ncatt_get(raster, "crs_HYRAS")$epsg_code
```

## Variable layer

Now, we also need the actual variable we're looking for.
In this case, it's *tas* (for mean daily temperature).
We can see that the dimensions are the largest and match our geospatial and time dimensions: 240 (*x_bnds*) $\times$ 220 (*y_bnds*) $\times$ 365 (*time_bnds*).

Let's get this variable's array out.
Additionally, let's find out how the `NA`s are coded, and use that information to code them as `NA`s that `R` recognizes.

```{r}
#| label: saving-variable

variable_array <- ncvar_get(raster, "tas")
fillvalue <- ncatt_get(raster, "tas", "_FillValue")

# set NA value
variable_array[variable_array == fillvalue$value] <- NA
```

## Close nc file

Now we have all the information we need, yay!
Let's not forget to close the `.nc` file again.

```{r}
#| label: close-nc
nc_close(raster)
```

# Extracting the layer with `ncdf4`

Now for the fun part!
Let's get out the day that we want -- `r day_of_year`.
We first do this with `ncdf4` and the information we already gathered.
We could, however, also do this with `terra`.

## Making a raster

Next, we make a `rast`er of this with the `terra` package.
We already know the structure of the array, where time is the last layer.
This does vary over different files though!

We declare the extent and the crs that we extracted in @sec-vars.
Then, let's go ahead and plot it!

```{r}
#| label: layer-doy

got_weather_array <- variable_array[,, day_of_year]
got_weather_raster <- got_weather_array |> 
  terra::rast(extent = ext(min(lon),
                             max(lon),
                             min(lat),
                             max(lat)),
                crs = crs)
plot(got_weather_raster)
```

Well, this somewhat looks like Germany ... but not quite yet.
We need to mirror it and turn it by 90°.

## Transposing the raster 

For this, we need to go back to the last step, and transpose the 2-dimensional array for our specific day.
Then, we make it a `rast`er again.


```{r}
#| label: rast-transpose

got_weather_raster_transposed <- got_weather_array |>
  t() |>
  terra::rast(extent = ext(min(lon),
                           max(lon),
                           min(lat),
                           max(lat)),
              crs = crs)

got_weather_raster_transposed |> 
  plot()

```

Well, this is almost right -- we just need to turn it upside down now.

## Flipping the raster

For this task, `terra` has a specific function, `flip`.
We can say which way to flip the raster -- in this case, vertically.
Let's go ahead and plot this again.

```{r}
#| label: turn-raster-upside-down

got_weather_raster_right_side_up <- got_weather_raster_transposed |> 
  flip(direction = "vertical")

got_weather_raster_right_side_up |> plot()
```

And there we have it!

# Taking the shortcut with `terra`

An alternative way of reading `.nc` data into a `rast`er is using `terra::rast()` directly.

```{r}
#| label: load-into-terra

raster_terra <- rast(raster_path,
                     drivers = "NETCDF")

```

In this case, the layer structure is rather easy:
We simply have 365 layers for *tas*.

```{r}
#| label: check-out-terra-layers

raster_terra |> 
  names() |> 
  data.frame(layer_name = _) |> 
  tidyr::separate_wider_delim(layer_name, 
                              names = c("variable", "day"),
                              delim = "_") |> 
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))

```

In such an easy case, we can extract the layer for our *day_of_year* as follows:

```{r}
#| label: extract-layer-terra

raster_terra[[day_of_year]] |> plot()
```


And there we have it -- we extracted the weather on the day after the last episode of Game of Thrones aired!
In the South, weather was a lot colder, so maybe more people watched the last episode there.
