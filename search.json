My academic work revolves around exploring and interpreting complex datasets to uncover new insights. I primarily code in R, a language and environment that I find well-suited for statistical analysis and graphical techniques in my research.\nI have a particular interest in the challenge of data wrangling – organizing, cleaning, and transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis. This crucial step in the research process allows me to delve deep into the data, uncovering patterns and trends that might otherwise remain hidden.\nOne of my key strengths is in creating clear, compelling visuals to present my findings. I believe that good visualizations are essential for effectively communicating complex data insights."

    "text": "Prettier table\nHowever, the output in Table 1 is not very pretty yet. It’s not entirely clear yet what the independent variable is, we don’t know what (1) and (2) stand for, and we have a mass of goodness-of-fit measures. Let’s customize our table!\nAs a first step, we make create some helper functions. These help with formatting the table.\n\n\nCode\n# format numbers: thousand separator\nf &lt;- function(x, n_digits = 2) {\n  ifelse(is.na(x),\n         \"\",\n         formatC(\n           x,\n           digits = n_digits,\n           big.mark = \",\",\n           format = \"f\"\n         ))\n}\n\nf_0 &lt;- purrr::partial(f, n_digits = 0)\n  \n#  function for GOF measures we don't want to change\nkeep_format &lt;- function(x) list(\"raw\" = x, \"clean\" = x, \"fmt\" = NA)\n\n\nThen, we create a list where we format our goodness-of-fit (GOF) measures. Some of the default names are not so pretty, e.g. Num.Observations without a space between the two words – so we switch them to shorter or nicer names.\n\n\nCode\n# format # observations and R^2, keep the rest\ngof_tidy &lt;- list(\n  list(\n    \"raw\" = \"nobs\",\n    \"clean\" = \"Observations\",\n    \"fmt\" = f_0\n  ),\n  list(\n    \"raw\" = \"r.squared\",\n    \"clean\" = \"R\\u00B2\",\n    \"fmt\" = 3\n  ),\n  keep_format(\"FE: Origin\"),\n  keep_format(\"FE: Destination\"),\n  keep_format(\"FE: Product\"),\n  keep_format(\"FE: Year\")\n)\n\n\nLet’s change the labels for our regression. We do this by adding names to the list’s input (lines 1–2).\nAs a next step, let’s use the label we added earlier on, by setting coef_rename to true. Let’s also format the numbers using the formatting function we set up earlier, f.\nLet’s omit some of the goodnes-of-fit (gof) indicators, since we don’t need all of them here. We do this with the gof_map argument, to which we supply our GOF list from the last step. Alternatively, we could use a regex in the gof_omit argument: anything that matches the expression in line 4 will not be included.\nAlso, I’m used to adding stars where a coefficient is significant. This is not added by default, so let’s simply set the stars argument to true.\nThen, we’re setting the output to gt, which gives us the possibility to further style the table with the package gt. We add a header detailing our dependent variable. Then, we add a spanner to tell readers that OLS and Poisson are regression models.\n\nlist(OLS = gravity_ols,\n     Poisson = gravity_pois) |&gt;\n  modelsummary(\n    coef_rename = TRUE,\n    gof_map = gof_tidy,\n    fmt = f,\n    stars = TRUE,\n    output = \"gt\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  # add header and spanner\n  tab_header(title = \"Dependent variable: Trade flow [€]\") |&gt;\n  tab_spanner(\n    label = \"Regression model\",\n    columns = c(\"OLS\", \"Poisson\")\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Some regressions – prettier \n  \n    \n      Dependent variable: Trade flow [€]\n    \n    \n    \n       \n      \n        Regression model\n      \n    \n    \n      OLS\n      Poisson\n    \n  \n  \n    Log (distance [km])\n-47,643.02***\n-0.00***\n    \n(10,905.57)\n(0.00)\n    Observations\n38,325\n38,325\n    R²\n0.286\n0.751\n    FE: Origin\nX\nX\n    FE: Destination\nX\nX\n    FE: Product\nX\nX\n    FE: Year\nX\nX\n  \n  \n    \n      + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001"
